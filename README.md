Designer Notes:

I enjoyed doing this project. But I honestly hated the javascript section. I obviously still have more to learn. There was a bit of an issue trying to render the grid as soon I hit submit. There were other projects with the same issue. Not sure if it was a bug or anything, but I did try and look for the cause since that's what developers do - problem solving. No such luck however. The frustration was real.

I stepped back for a bit then came back to it later on. I absolutely loved HTML and CSS. Designing the style and look is a favorite of mine. I definitely try and put myself in the user's point of view. I tried using an 80s theme since I always get a deep nostalgic feel every time I think about the decade. Plus the music was top notch back then so that too.

If you look through the CSS file and find an image grayed out that's because I tried using one as a background. I tested it on codepen (https://codepen.io/idSolomon/full/zWLzmo/) but the result wasn't what I expected. It didn't look right so I used a linear-gradient instead with a background color.
